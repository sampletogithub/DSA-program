## Data Structures

The `DataStructureExample` class demonstrates the following data structures:

- **Arrays**: Basic operations and manipulations.
- **Linked Lists**: Implementation of singly and doubly linked lists.
- **Trees**: Basic binary tree operations and traversals.

## Algorithms

The `AlgorithmExample` class includes implementations of common algorithms:

- **Sorting Algorithms**: 
  - Bubble Sort
  - Quick Sort
- **Searching Algorithms**: 
  - Binary Search

## Running Tests

To run the tests, ensure you have Maven installed. Navigate to the project directory and execute the following command:

```
mvn test
```

This will compile the project and run all the unit tests defined in the `DataStructureExampleTest` and `AlgorithmExampleTest` classes.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Use Maven to build the project and run tests.
