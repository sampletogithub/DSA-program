# DSA Project

This project is focused on implementing various data structures and algorithms in Java. The goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of how these concepts work and to demonstrate their usage through practical examples.

## Project Structure

- **src/**: Contains the source code for the project.
  - **algorithms/**: This directory will include implementations of various algorithms.
    - **README.md**: Documentation related to the algorithms implemented in this project.
  - **data_structures/**: This directory will include implementations of different data structures.
    - **README.md**: Documentation related to the data structures implemented in this project.
  - **Main.java**: The entry point for the Java application, which will demonstrate the algorithms and data structures.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the Java files using your preferred IDE or command line.
4. Run the `Main.java` file to see the implementations in action.

## Usage

This project is intended for educational purposes. You can modify and extend the implementations as needed to better understand data structures and algorithms.
