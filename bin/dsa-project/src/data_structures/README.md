# Data Structures Documentation

This directory contains implementations and explanations of various data structures that will be utilized in this project. 

## Data Structures Included

1. **Arrays**: A collection of elements identified by index or key.
2. **Linked Lists**: A linear collection of data elements where each element points to the next.
3. **Stacks**: A collection of elements that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.
4. **Queues**: A collection of elements that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle.
5. **Trees**: A hierarchical structure consisting of nodes, with a single root and sub-nodes.
6. **Graphs**: A collection of nodes connected by edges, representing relationships between pairs of objects.

## Usage

Each data structure will have its own implementation file, along with example usage and performance considerations. 

## Contribution

Feel free to contribute by adding new data structures or improving existing implementations.
